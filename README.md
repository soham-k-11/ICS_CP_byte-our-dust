INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE VOTING SYSTEM:
1. Install all the files in your dekstop and store them in a single folder.
2. Now, Open the folder in the IDE of your choice (preferably VSCode or CodeBlocks).
3. B23ME1066_B23ME1047.c contains the "main" function and all other functions are written in B23ME1066_B23EE1065.c so they must be in the same directory (that is the reason why we stored all files in a single folder).
4. The program data is stored in the files so DO NOT DELETE THEM.
5. The program is completely menu driven so its self explanatory.
6. 4-digit passcode- 1920
7. 3-digit voting ID- should be >=101 and <=199
8. Note- Enter an integer where integer is asked and enter a character where a character is asked for user to enter otherwise the program may fail.
